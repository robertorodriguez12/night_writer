## Night Writer Project

### Objectives
The objectives and learning goals for this project are the following:
  * To practice breaking a program in to logical components
  * Testing components in isolation and in combination
  * Applying Enumerable techniques in a real context
  * Reading text from a file
  * Create a method that will create a new file
  * Write into the newly created file

### Background
The idea of Night Writing was first developed for Napoleon’s army so soldiers
could communicate silently at night without light. The concept of night writing
led to Louis Braille’s development of his Braille tactile writing system.

### Project Requirements
The requirements for this project is to create a program from scratch that will
translate an english message into braille and create a separate program that
will translate from braille back to english.
```
This project does not include a base repository/starter repository not does
it include an interaction pattern. This will test my ability to create a
program when only given instructions on what it should do.
```

### Contributors
Myself

### Execution pattern
In order to execute the NightWriter program you must
first do the following:
  * Clone this repository to your machine
  * From your root NightWriter directory
    * run the following code : ```ruby ./lib/night_writer.rb <original message file path> <name of file to be created and translated into>```
  * To run the NightReader program(which translates a braille message to english)
    * In the same NightWriter root directory
      * run the following code : ```ruby ./lib/night_reader.rb <original message file path> <name of file to be created and translated into>```

## Enjoy!!!!
